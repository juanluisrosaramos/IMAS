## Establishing a Working methodology

First of all, we created two ways of exchanging information  for meeting or task coordination: 

*  an email distribution list for keeping us in contact and exchange some initial information.
*  a Whatsapp group in case we need some urgent information (like someone lost on his way to a meeting room) 

Initially Carles -our senior developer- opened a new project in Gitlab.com and send an email to the group with some instructions.
*The first email* contained useful information about how  to set up our working tools Netbeans. He explained us how GIT works and assign us a "warm-up task" that contains: 

*  create a *personal **gitlab** account* so Carles by can connect us to the Gitlab project
*  **NetBeans** 
	* install it 
	* connect it to the project Git repository
* practice some **Markdown** coding as we will keep all the documentation in the Git repository

The *"warm-up" task* had a due date of a week after. At this point, all the communication was being settled-up by email. Some personal doubts appeared, specially in the Git environment. We were having some delays with the first task delivering. So, we moved our communication to the whats-app group. We chatted by Waths-app the problems as anyone has different environments in their laptops (linux, mac and windows) we decided to extend some days the due date of the first task. Working individually at home we will then have our first meeting for resolving doubts with the senior developer. We also considered the possibilities of having a hangouts remote meetings using our webcams.

We tried to find a date for our first meeting but we chatted to much without arriving to a conclusion. Finally after a long conversation we find a date for the first meeting.


## First meeting morning 27th Sept 2016 9-10 kick off project.##

We meet us in a UB study room. The first point of the day was a first lesson learned. **Whats-app isn't a good tool for project management**. Whats-app seems an immediate an nearly face to face working and immediate communication tool but, this isn't true. Anyone is doing something else and we aren't really paying attention to the working related tasks. So, we decide to use chatting as the minimum necessary.

Next point of the day was to resolve some with GIT (theoretical concepts) doubts. We explained what is a repository Gitlab to our mathematicians and physicians and we also explained what is a task manager (tasks, sub tasks and milestones) because we decide **moving to a Task Management tools** for project management (gitlab provides its own task management tool). After 45 mins we finish and we decide to have a weekly meeting on Thursdays 18h after classes in the UPC.

## Second Meeting on Thursday 28th 18h

We have a new member of the group, Sean. Welcome kit, new profile in gitlab and we assign him "the warm up task" (install Netbeans, git and markdown). After closing the warm-up task from the task manager tool provided by GitLab we move to assign Project Roles.

* coders
* analysts
* documentators 

Our **next Milestone** will be the *first delivery* and the due date is *6th Nov*. The first task of this milestone will be **to describe the environment and the agents architecture** . As Sean suggested we are not going to distribute this task between our roles because we still have time and we all want to learn and practice the lessons learned in the course. So, this task was assigned to each one of us. We decide to bring our ideas next week a build a mashup for the delivery.

**We will open a new task for this "describe environment and agent properties" with a deadline of Thursday 6th of October.**

## Third Meeting on Thursday 5th October 18h

The task manager worked very efficiently so we can move directly to the point of the meeting. We  discussed our own opinions about the environment. After some discrepancies we arrive to the same point. We also agree in the agent architecture and how we want to build our agent platform. Finally, we decided to assign the next tasks. Revise and check our first agreement and think about the agents properties.
